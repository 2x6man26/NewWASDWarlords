                I thought I knew what I would do <br>
                I thought I had a clue <br>
                I said to myself “I will persevere,” <br>
                But there was nothing to persevere for <br>
                The feelings I had were severe <br>
                But all they did was take my emotions on a world tour <br>
                Now I know the difference between love and limerence <br>
                And I won’t waste valuable time on people who don’t care about me <br>
                I will guard my heart with more vigilance <br>
                I will not allow myself to be flung around like a wave on the sea

                Oh what joy it is to know <br>
                He who resides within me doth make me grow <br>
                To say to him that he is mine <br>
                And that he cares for me all the time <br>
                For my errors his life was taken <br>
                So that he and I could be considered kin <br>
                And I in him doth try to abide <br>
                My father takes all the troubles of mine <br>
                What did I do to deserve such treasure <br>
                Absolutely nothing, it is his good pleasure

                Nic was the first to learn of the mini car’s subpar suspension<br>
                Lilly chided him for his reckless behavior and apprehension<br>
                Soon all made an observation that changed their behavior<br>
                Amongst the many different cars they all had the same flavor<br>
                They were all so terribly, very, horribly slow!<br>
                Mrs. Cantu had something she was waiting to show<br>
                First, dinner in a sushi restaurant, and we were shown to a back room<br>
                Cyrus was fretting, thinking it could be our tomb<br>
                None were hurt, though Lola was mistaken for a gnome<br>
                Who should be ready to meet us but Luke Combs!<br>
                He showed us what we’d not yet seen, a fast car<br>
                We flew down the road, tearing up the tar<br>
                Traveling together from sea to sea<br>
                Jake pleaded with him to stop because he had to pee<br>
                An hour and a half of bickering then we arrived<br>
                To the place which we used the fast car to drive<br>
                It was a karaoke palace!<br>
                Nothing like the kind they have in Dallas<br>
                John pushed his way to the front of the line<br>
                He needed everybody to know he was staying alive<br>
                Cate sang Kiss Me then things got weird, but most stayed mature<br>
                However there was one person that we didn’t notice in the tour<br>
                All the patrons cheered when next up to sing was Ed Sheeran!<br>
                He told Amy that he’d love to hear her sing Perfect, and off she ran<br>
                We all circled up to hold hands and sing<br>
                We saved Christmas, and our voices rang

                I wander through the world in search of love<br>
                In Tinder, Church, and Starbucks I find naught<br>
                I weep at every distant flying dove<br>
                I wonder when I’ll find what I have sought<br>
                Why is this soul in such a desperate state?<br>
                No love was found in places high and low<br>
                Is loneliness forever just their fate?<br>
                Is there a way that I could help them grow?<br>
                No is certainly that questions answer<br>
                For some are too far gone even to help<br>
                A sorry excuse for a romancer<br>
                When some look at them they might even yelp<br>
                They do not know that they are the problem<br>
                There is no one who could ever love them
