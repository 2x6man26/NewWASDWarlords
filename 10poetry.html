            <p class="hidden-paragraph">
                I thought I knew what I would do <br>
                I thought I had a clue <br>
                I said to myself “I will persevere,” <br>
                But there was nothing to persevere for <br>
                The feelings I had were severe <br>
                But all they did was take my emotions on a world tour <br>
                Now I know the difference between love and limerence <br>
                And I won’t waste valuable time on people who don’t care about me <br>
                I will guard my heart with more vigilance <br>
                I will not allow myself to be flung around like a wave on the sea

                Oh what joy it is to know <br>
                He who resides within me doth make me grow <br>
                To say to him that he is mine <br>
                And that he cares for me all the time <br>
                For my errors his life was taken <br>
                So that he and I could be considered kin <br>
                And I in him doth try to abide <br>
                My father takes all the troubles of mine <br>
                What did I do to deserve such treasure <br>
                Absolutely nothing, it is his good pleasure
