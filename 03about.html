                    I am Levi Donaldson, the developer of this project. I was born and raised in Texas.
                    My home address is on Earth. I was born at a very young age.
                    Our team is Gigachad (Marketing Specialist),
                    The Intruder (Door to Door Salesman),
                    William Afton (Childcare Attendant),
                    and Levi (Head Idiot/Goofball in training). 
                    We all help where needed.

                    Our team is a group of committed individuals who may or may not have been sourced from the street
                    and or a modeling agency. In fact, this website would not exist if I couldn't use Chat GPT and slave labo-
                    I mean helpful friends. This website is primarily for my fun and education.
